<h1>Bhubaneswar Medical Center</h1>
<p>Recently expanded, the Forest Park Medical Center in Dallas offers many upgraded, state-of-the-art amenities and a beautiful design. In addition to the added 14 operating rooms, 48 private patient beds and 12 ICU beds, the expansion also includes a Class A, 6-story, 130,000-square-foot medical office building. The interior includes spaces with auditorium-style seating, modern lounge areas, floor to ceiling glass walls, and cool tones to give the building a modern feel. Patient rooms are warm and comfortable, utilizing elements like hardwood floors, large windows, and sleek finishes to make a patientâ€™s stay more like a luxury retreat than a recovery period. The modern design flows out to the exterior, where there are areas for drive-thru banking, restaurants, pharmacy and other retail opportunities to make this more than just a hospital.</p>
